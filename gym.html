            <p>Physical fitness is the state of a body's health and ability to perform everyday work and leisure activities efficiently and effectively. According to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, most experts agree that the essential aspects of physical fitness include morphological fitness, bone strength, muscular fitness, flexibility, motor fitness, cardiovascular fitness and metabolic fitness.</p>
        <p>According to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, physical activity is "any form of exercise or movement of the body that uses energy." It can include activities such as walking the dog, yard work and household chores. For children ages six to 17, a minimum of 60 minutes of physical aerobic activity is recommended per day to ensure physical fitness, while 30 minutes or more of physical aerobic activity per day is recommended for adults.</p>
        <p>The President's Challenge focuses on four categories when determining the overall level of physical fitness of an adult. These categories are aerobic fitness, which is the ability of the heart and lungs to deliver blood to muscles; muscular strength and endurance, which measures whether one is strong enough to perform normal activities easily; flexibility, or the ability to move joints through their proper range of motion; and body composition, or the level of body fat in the body, especially around the waist.</p>
        <p>MedlinePlus states that physical activity is very important for bodily health and can lower the risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as help to control weight, strengthen bone and muscle, and improve mental health and mood. According to Wikipedia, correct nutrition, exercise, hygiene, and rest all contribute to achieving physical fitnessS</p>
